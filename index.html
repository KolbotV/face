                <h2>About the project</h2>
                <p>This project will seek to create opportunities for faculty, staff, and students at three Minnesota liberal arts colleges to connect with community consultants and collaborators in order to gather ideas about the feasibility of designing a skills-based career preparation pathway program for arts and humanities students that will be mutually beneficial for all participants. Project leads and student collaborators will gather tools from guest artists, storytellers, and speakers who use arts and humanities approaches to facilitate interactions around the project theme of "Belonging."</p>
